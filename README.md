# antifreeze

a swiss army knife multi-tool script for [LJE](https://github.com/yogwoggf/lj-expand) (a tool for garry's mod allowing you to run clientside lua with basically no detection)

you wouldnt stab someone with a multi-tool would you? don't cheat for your own gain.

forked from [gilbhax](https://github.com/yogwoggf/gilbhax)

requires [ljeutil](https://github.com/Eyoko1/ljeutil)
